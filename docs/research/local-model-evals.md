# Local model evaluations

A running log of every time this server is measured with a local model, and what was changed because
of it. **Add a round whenever the server is tested or tuned with a model**: the figures, the build
they were taken on, what changed before it, and what the transcripts showed.

## How a round is run and recorded

```bash
npm run build                          # the eval drives the built server: dist/ must be current
npm run eval:ollama -- --client openclaw --model gemma4:e4b --openclaw-agent skyrim-e4b --detailed   # the round recorded here
```

From round 23 a round measures gemma4:e4b alone: what the smallest model gets done, the larger ones get
done too — in round 22, 26b passed 39 of 39 and 12b 37 where e4b passed 33 — and an e4b round takes 40
minutes where all three took four hours. Until round 22, e4b probes went unrecorded, and the round was
every model's.

[`scripts/eval-ollama.mjs`](../../scripts/eval-ollama.mjs) runs the tasks below through the built
server against the instance in `.env`, with its own agent loop on Ollama's `/api/chat`, then measures
the model's speed. At the end it prints the entry for this log — the summary row and the per-task
table — and saves it beside the JSON record of every call (`<out>.md`, `<out>.json`; by default under
the system temp folder). Paste the entry into a new round below, and write down what changed before it
and what the transcripts showed.

Before the first task the script loads the model with a short "hi" at the round's context, so no task
pays for the load; a model that was not loaded yet (a switch) gets `--settle` seconds more (60).
`--client openclaw` runs the same tasks through OpenClaw itself, headless (`openclaw agent exec`), with
the model behind a logging proxy in front of Ollama ([`scripts/eval-openclaw.mjs`](../../scripts/eval-openclaw.mjs)):
the client the user chats through, on their own OpenClaw configuration (`~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`,
or `--openclaw-config`) — its system prompt and tools, Tool Search, the thinking level and the context
it asks Ollama for, and one agent (`--openclaw-agent`, else `skyrim`) with its workspace files
(AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, USER.md…) in the prompt as a gateway puts them. The eval changes only what a
measurement needs: this server alone, on a fresh projects folder, without `deployProject`, `installMod`
and `downloadNexusFile`; OpenClaw's shell (`exec`, `process`) and the tools that reach a paired device
(`nodes`, `file_fetch`, `file_write`, `dir_list`, `dir_fetch`) denied; the model under test configured
and allowed. Its entry adds a line: the
first prompt's tokens and tools, the thinking, num_ctx and num_predict (the answer cap, from the model's
`params.num_predict`) OpenClaw sent, the time to the first token, answers cut off, turns Ollama ended at
the length limit — the cap, or the context's end — and side requests. Its seconds include each session's start, where the server builds its
record index again. `+skill` runs are left out there. Until 2026-10-18 the second client was Claude
Code (`--client claude-code`; `scripts/eval-claude-code.mjs` is in git history).

**The tasks.** Each is checked against the instance itself, never against values written into the
script. Nothing is deployed: `deployProject` stays listed, but a call to it is refused (through
OpenClaw it is left out of the list).

| task | the prompt asks | passes when |
|---|---|---|
| find | which plugin defines the Iron Sword, and its FormID | the answer names `012EB7` (any spelling of the FormID) and `Skyrim.esm` |
| read | the Iron Sword's damage and weight in the load order | the answer has both numbers as the instance has them |
| filter | three armor pieces Dawnguard.esm adds, with FormIDs | three FormIDs that are ARMO records defined in Dawnguard.esm |
| patch | a patch IronSwordBuff raising the Iron Sword's damage to 12, not built | the project's copy has `Damage: 12`, its editor ID and its weight unchanged |
| build | a patch SteelSwordLight in which the Steel Sword weighs 5, built | the copy has `Weight: 5`, and buildProject succeeded and wrote the plugin |
| sword | a new mod FlameBlade: a new one-handed sword "Flame Blade" with a fire damage enchantment, built | a new weapon of that name (its FormID in the project's own plugin), a one-handed sword, whose enchantment lists a fire effect (`ResistValue: ResistFire`), and the build succeeded |
| spell | a new mod StormBolt: a new Destruction spell "Storm Bolt" that deals shock damage, built | a new spell of that name, with an effect of the Destruction school and a shock effect (`ResistShock`), and the build succeeded |
| npc | a new mod HildaTheNord: one new NPC, a female Nord named "Hilda", built | a new NPC of that name, of the race NordRace (read from the instance), flagged Female, and the build succeeded |
| note | a new mod MavenNote: a new note "Maven's Warning" with exactly the text of the vanilla note "Note From Maven", built | a new book of that name whose text is the vanilla one (read from the instance; whitespace collapsed, so how a block is folded does not count, but a `\"` or `\n` left in does), and the build succeeded |

**No escapes copied** (from round 15): every task that leaves record files also passes only when none
of them holds an escape a copy should have decoded — a doubled backslash or a `\"` outside a
double-quoted string, or one still there once the string is decoded. It is what copying a JSON string
as it reads leaves: e4b wrote `File: Weapons\\Iron\\Sword.nif` in rounds 12–13. `note` (from round 15)
is the task built to show it: a text with quotes and line breaks, and a model path with backslashes.

The authoring tasks (from round 9) author new records by hand, following vanilla ones. A link — the sword's
enchantment, a spell's effects — is followed into the project when the model wrote the record there,
and into the load order (through `readRecord`) when it used a vanilla one; either passes.

**With the skill read** (from round 12): `--with-skills` runs each authoring task again as `sword+skill`,
`spell+skill`, `npc+skill` — the conversation starting with the task's family skill already read, a
`readSkill` call the harness makes and puts in as the model's, left out of the counts. The plain task
measures whether a model finds the skill; the `+skill` one, what the skill does once read.

**With a detailed prompt** (from round 14): `--detailed` runs each authoring task again as
`sword+detailed`, `spell+detailed`, `npc+detailed`, with a prompt that spells out what a player who
knows the game would ask for — like the Iron Sword but 12 damage and a 10-point fire enchantment with
a charge of 500; an Apprentice shock bolt like Lightning Bolt, 40 damage, 60 magicka; a Nord woman
warrior, levels 5–30, in iron armor — and no editor IDs. The checks are the plain task's.

**The columns.** *calls*: tool calls per run, file tools included. *invalid arguments*: calls refused
with `InvalidParams`. *other errors*: every other failed call, file tools included. *largest prompt*:
the most tokens Ollama evaluated in one turn. *seconds*: per run, mean. *s/turn*: mean time of a
model turn, the session's first (the model loading) left out. *prompt* and *generation*: how fast
the model reads a prompt and writes an answer on this machine at the round's context — the tool
reference (~2,400 tokens since round 9) summarised in 300 tokens, three times, the median of each,
with thinking off. The script measures it after the tasks, apart from them: their turns reuse
Ollama's prompt cache and answer in a few dozen tokens, so figures taken from them would not compare.
*GPU*: the share of the model Ollama put on the GPU.

**The machine**, unless a round says otherwise: Windows 11, RTX 5080 16 GB, 32 GB RAM; Ollama 0.40.4
with `OLLAMA_FLASH_ATTENTION=1`, `OLLAMA_KV_CACHE_TYPE=q8_0`; num_ctx 131072; the model's own defaults
otherwise (gemma4: thinking on, temperature 1); three runs per task, seeds 1001–1003. The instance is
the test instance — a portable Mod Organizer on Skyrim SE 1.7.104 with no mods.

Rounds 1–5 ran before the script measured speed; their *prompt* and *generation* were measured
afterwards the same way — they are the model's and the machine's, not the build's.

Only the latest two rounds keep their details below. The earlier ones — what changed before each and
what its transcripts showed — are in this file's history: `git log -p -- docs/research/local-model-evals.md`.

## Reference measurements

Measurements of a setting rather than of a build, kept whole.

### Thinking off (2026-10-16, gemma4:e4b, db246fb)

`--think false`, against round 14's e4b run with gemma4's default (thinking on), the same 42 tasks:

| | passed | invalid arguments | other errors | turns | seconds, all runs |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| thinking on (round 14) | 41/42 | 13 | 1 | 226 | 417 |
| thinking off | 25/42 | 32 | 19 | 322 | 246 |

41% less time, 16 tasks lost — spread over every authoring task (`npc+detailed` 0/3). **Leave thinking
on.** It is where the time goes: in round 14 generated tokens were ~90% of 26b's wall time and thinking
~60% of those, against ~13% for reading every tool answer. Answers in fewer tokens could not buy much
time; that is why round 15 measures answer formats for quality instead.

### Thinking medium (2026-10-21, gemma4:e4b, afd183d)

`thinkingDefault: medium` for the `skyrim-e4b` agent, on a copy of the user's OpenClaw configuration —
theirs is `max`, which OpenClaw sends to Ollama as `think: "high"` — against round 27 on the same build,
run straight after it, the same 39 tasks:

| | passed | authoring | invalid arguments | other errors | turns | seconds, all runs | thinking per turn (chars) | output tokens |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| high (round 27) | 35/39 | 20/24 | 28 | 10 | 311 | 2,301 | 1,434 | 162,808 |
| medium | 34/39 | 19/24 | 34 | 6 | 336 | 2,489 | 1,441 | 187,400 |

At medium e4b thought as much per turn as at high, took more turns and time, and passed one run fewer. The
turns that plan and make no call — they ended one run in each of rounds 23–26 — did not go away: two of
medium's five misses planned their fix and stopped (round 27: one of four), and a third, sword+detailed #3,
wrote its last call into its thinking, ending in gemma4's own tool-call tokens (`…FlameBlade.yaml<|"|>}<tool_call|>`),
which Ollama passed on as no call; it then told the user the mod was built. That is the only turn in rounds
22–27 that lost a call so. **Keep the user's setting.** One run of each shows no gain from medium; with rounds
moving by about three passes on their own, it does not show a loss either.

### Claude Code as the client (2026-10-16, Claude Code 2.1.301 on Ollama's Anthropic endpoint)

The VS Code extension with `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` at Ollama, measured through a logging proxy on the
`find` question (gemma4:26b unless noted):

| setup | first prompt (tokens) | tools | first token of the first turn |
|---|---|---|---|
| as installed: every built-in tool, the user's three other MCP servers | 41,652 | 66 | 106 s |
| the built-ins a modding session does not use denied (e4b) | 10,099 | 41 | 2.8 s |
| … and non-essential traffic off | 9,905 | 41 | 8.7 s |
| … and only this server and a web search (the workspace) | 7,757 | 23 | 7.6 s |

Claude Code's own built-in tools were 135 KB of the first prompt's 159 KB of tool schemas (`Artifact`
alone 32 KB; this server's 14 tools 14 KB). Denied in a folder's `.claude/settings.json`
(`permissions.deny`), a tool leaves the prompt. The 106 s were 26b loading, then a session-title request
Claude Code sends the main model before the first turn — 1,699 tokens with thinking, 66 s, and the turn
queued behind it. `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC=1` stops that request. Naming a smaller
model for side requests (`ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL`, `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL`) moves it, but on
a 16 GB card that cannot hold both, each side request swaps the models, ~30 s each way. After the first
turn the prompt cache holds: 1–5 s to the first token per turn. Claude Code hands the server's answer
to the model as one text block, as sent. An answer stopping midway, as a user reported, did not happen
in these runs; `--client claude-code` counts every answer that ends without `message_stop`.

Round 16's `--client claude-code` ran in that lean setup: the same denied built-ins, non-essential
traffic off, side requests on the model under test, only this server. OpenClaw replaced it as the
eval's second client on 2026-10-18.

### OpenClaw as the client (2026-10-18, OpenClaw 2026.10.4 on Ollama's native API)

The user's OpenClaw, gemma4:26b, through `--client openclaw` and a probe proxy (`find` and `patch`, one
run each, b192d20 + the new client):

| setup | passed | first prompt (tokens) | tools | think | first token of the first turn |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| as configured: Tool Search automatic, thinking OpenClaw's default | 0/2 | 7,880 | 10, this server's behind Tool Search | false | 42 s |
| `tools.toolSearch: false`, `params.thinking: "medium"` for the model | 2/2 | 26,093 | 57, 16 of them this server's | medium | 24–59 s |

- **The context was 32,768.** OpenClaw's model discovery wrote `contextTokens: 32768` into the model's
  entry, and the native adapter sends it as `options.num_ctx`; the user's longer chats failed with
  "request (34099 tokens) exceeds the available context size (32768 tokens)". Set to 131,072 — what the
  eval and the user's Ollama use, so the model is not reloaded between them.
- **Thinking is off** unless configured: for local Ollama models OpenClaw's implicit level is `off`
  (`think: false` on every request). `agents.defaults.models["ollama/<model>"].params.thinking` sets it;
  Ollama takes `think: "medium"` for gemma4. Thinking off cost e4b 41/42 → 25/42 (above).
- **Tool Search hides this server.** With `tools.toolSearch` unset, OpenClaw puts every MCP tool behind
  `tool_search` / `tool_describe` / `openclaw_tool_call` for local models and does not name them in the
  prompt. 26b never found them: it searched its memory, listed folders, called `tool_search` through
  `openclaw_tool_call`, and answered that it could not reach the Skyrim installation (33 turns in a probe
  without a task limit). Found through a search, an answer comes back wrapped as untrusted external
  content. The setting is global, not per agent.
- **The server's `instructions` never reach the model** — OpenClaw's MCP client does not read them, with
  Tool Search or without. What a model learns of this server is the tool descriptions. OpenClaw's own
  skills, by contrast, are listed in its prompt with the order to read a matching one before working.
- With Tool Search off, OpenClaw's own 41 tools are most of the 97 KB of schemas (in a probe
  `automations` alone was 16 KB, `sessions_spawn` 10 KB). No conversation's first turn was served from
  Ollama's prompt cache: every new chat reads the whole prompt again, 24–59 s on 26b.
- `agent exec` on Windows: its temporary state folder fails to delete (a SQLite file still open, `EBUSY`)
  and the run's answer is lost with it, so the eval gives each run a state folder of its own.

**The modding agent** setup writes (`skyrim`: the modding skills as OpenClaw skills, thinking `max` — sent
to Ollama as `think: "high"` — and only `read`, `write`, `edit`, `apply_patch`, `ls`, `skills_read` and
`skyrim__*`), measured on `find`, `patch`, `sword`, `npc`, `note`, one run each:

| Tool Search | passed | turns (find / patch / sword / npc / note) | first prompt (tokens) | tools | first token |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| off | 4/5 | 2 / 5 / 25 / 7 / 8 | 7,219 | 22, 16 of them this server's | 8 s |
| on | 4/5 | 8 / 15 / 19 / 6 / 15 | 4,242 | 8, this server's behind Tool Search | 25 s |

The allow list takes the first prompt from 26,093 tokens to 7,219. With Tool Search on, every call to this
server is a search, a description and a call through `openclaw_tool_call` — two to three times the turns —
and its miss never used the server: told to make an NPC, 26b read the npcs skill, wrote the record, a
README and a `metadata.json` by hand, and answered that the mod was built. The miss with it off was the
model's: four turns lost calling `skills_read` with `skill:` instead of `name:`, then a potion's damage
effect on the enchantment, refused by the build, and the turns ran out. (The seconds do not compare: the
GPU ran the second half at ~184 tokens/s of prompt against ~891.)

## Round 28 — round 27's three fixes, gemma4:e4b alone (2026-10-21)

**Changed before it** — what round 27 pointed at (88b7ca9), and a fix found on the way (56a8a1b):

- A new enchantment that no record names is refused when the project has a weapon or armor that carries
  none — the user's choice — naming that record and the lines to write in it: `ObjectEffect:` and
  `EnchantmentAmount: 500` in a weapon, `ObjectEffect:` alone in an armor (none of the official plugins'
  3,007 enchanted armors has an EnchantmentAmount). With no such weapon or armor it stays the warning.
- A part of a record written as one value (`Archetype: ShockDamage`) is refused as that, naming
  `MutagenObjectType` and its kinds; where the value is one of the part's fields, that field's line is given.
- A new ValueModifier, PeakValueModifier, DualValueModifier or Absorb effect that names no actor value — or
  has no Archetype, which reads as a ValueModifier — is refused with the lines to write.
- A quest's `Filter:` may end in a backslash, as 1,992 of the official plugins' 2,522 quests do: the
  copied-escapes check refused addPatch's own copy of BQ01, and two of five serialized Creation Club plugins.

gemma4:e4b, `all`, OpenClaw (prompt ~7,410 tokens/s, generation ~173 tokens/s):

Through OpenClaw 2026.10.4 (383c124): first prompt 9,795 tokens (26 tools, 16 of them this server's),
think high, num_ctx 131072, no answer cap; no answer cut off, no turn ended at the length limit, no side
request; first token after 1.7 s, the median of the first turns.

**Seen.**

- **e4b 34 of 39** (round 27: 35), swords 3 of 6 (4 of 6), spells and NPCs 5 of 6 each, notes 6 of 6. Its
  turns took 3.5 s (3.43). Rounds 24–28 passed 38, 37, 38, 35 and 34.
- **The enchantment refusal came once, and was followed.** sword+detailed #3 had renamed an addPatch copy of
  IronSword and written an enchantment of its own. Told "FlameBlade carries no enchantment … write
  `ObjectEffect: FlameBladeBurn` and `EnchantmentAmount: 500` in FlameBlade, at the margin", it wrote both
  lines, with an edit that replaced `Stagger: 0.75`, Data's last line: ObjectEffect landed inside Data and
  Stagger was gone. Told to move it up, its two edits named the Stagger line it had deleted, and it told the
  user the mod was built. The part-as-value and actor-value refusals did not come up, and no answer was the
  reader's line and column.
- **npc #2 wrote the numbered file whole, without the FormKey line the build had given it.** Told "one record
  written twice … Make the changes there, and write Npcs/HildaTheNordNPC.yaml empty", it wrote the numbered
  file; with a FormKey in neither file, the refusal fell back to "give each new one an EditorID of its own,
  or write the file of one not needed empty", four times, and the old file was never emptied. The only such
  refusal in rounds 24–28.
- **spell #1 wrote a spell with neither EditorID nor Name.** Told it had no Name, its edit named
  `MenuDisplayObject: MAGINVShockSpellArt`, which the build had written as `09FA64:Skyrim.esm`; it built
  again unchanged and stopped. An edit on a line a build had rewritten came four times in rounds 27–28 and
  the thinking-medium run; this is the first that ended a run.
- **Two runs ended on a turn that planned and made no call** (sword #2, sword+detailed #2). OpenClaw answered
  each with the last tool's failure as `error_payload` ("⚠️ Skyrim Buildproject failed"), as once in each of
  rounds 24 and 25.

**What it points at next:** the enchantment refusal naming the line to write below — the record's `EditorID:`
line, which is at the margin and one of a kind (`ObjectEffect` and `EnchantmentAmount` written right below it
build into the plugin: checked, 2026-10-21); and the one-record-twice refusal knowing the numbered file by its
name when its FormKey line was written over.

## Round 29 — round 28's two answers, gemma4:e4b alone (2026-10-21)

**Changed before it** — what round 28 pointed at (b751186):

- The enchantment refusal says where the two lines go: "on the lines right below `EditorID: FlameBlade`, at
  the margin" — a line at the margin and one of a kind, where they build.
- The one-record-twice refusal knows the file a build numbered by the name the build gave it,
  `<EditorID> - <FormID>_<plugin>.yaml`, when that file was written again without its FormKey line, and goes
  on naming the file to write empty.

Through OpenClaw 2026.10.4 (383c124): first prompt 9,794 tokens (26 tools, 16 of them this server's),
think high, num_ctx 131072, no answer cap; no answer cut off, no turn ended at the length limit, one side
request; first token after 1.7 s, the median of the first turns.

**Seen.**

- **e4b 37 of 39** (round 28: 34), swords 5 of 6 (3 of 6), spells 6 of 6, NPCs 5 of 6, notes 6 of 6. Its
  turns took 3.32 s (3.5). Rounds 25–29 passed 37, 38, 35, 34 and 37.
- **Neither new answer came into play, nor any of round 27's three:** no new enchantment went unnamed, no
  record was written twice, no part was written as one value, no magic effect lacked its actor value.
- **sword+detailed #2 spent its turns on edits that did not match.** Refused once — IronSword's FormKey
  copied, and a top-level `Value` that is BasicStats' — it made 16 edits and the edit tool refused 14: each of
  the first six held one whose old text had its line break written as `\n`, and failed whole; most of the
  rest named lines it had already changed. It ran out of turns after its one build.
- **npc #3 stopped on a turn that planned and made no call.** Refused for Adelaisa's FormKey, copied, and five
  of PlayerSkills' fields at the margin, it removed the FormKey line, read the npcs skill, and its last turn
  planned to write the file anew; no write and no second build followed.

**What it points at next:** nothing on the server's side in this round's misses — one is the edit tool's and
the model's, the other a turn that made no call. The answers of rounds 27 and 28 came up once in two rounds;
whether they help shows only over more rounds.
